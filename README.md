This was my first project in java (and spigot) to create a plugin with the idea of being a replacement to marriage plugins (for servers in creative mode). 


Most of the practices are weird and overcomplicated but still relevant for some reason (specifically commons module)
## Thanks to
- Intake: first command framework I use
- LuckPerms: class loading and database practices (dependency management too)
- PGM: good practices
- CommandFlow: second command framework
- JDBC: weird but useful
- Gson: another weird but minimalistic lib
- Commons Apache: nice utils
- Guava: better than apache
- Caffeine: better than guava (cache)
- And more projects!
